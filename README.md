#SELinux Learning Resource Research and Development Project



This project was inspired by my own experience teaching students about Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) at Rochester Institute of Technology. I found that learning how to use SELinux in a practical sense to confine common applications (e.g. Apache) was difficult given existing resources. The SELinux policy architecture has changed so much throughout the years that it can be difficult to know what is still relevant. 

Another issue I found was modifying policy to remove access. Most resources discuss the usage of audit troubleshooting to allow some denied access but it does not specify the course of action for a policy that is too well confined.

I developed this research with the help of Professors Justin Pelletier and Bill Stackpole at Rochester Institute of Technology to perform a literature learning analysis and develop a resource that fills some of the gaps of existing resources. This was completed during the Fall of 2021 and still has plenty of future work, including more advanced examples and subjects of SELinux (e.g. MLS) to be covered.

Feel free to use the documentation however you like and read the research paper if you'd like to know more! As always, my contact is cxr5971@rit.edu. Reach out if you have questions, comments, or concerns.
